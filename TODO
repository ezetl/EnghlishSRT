- Avoid duplicates in the same frame (when a word appear twice in the same sentence)

- Implement an alternate way of parsing srt (without regex).
- Add option to put unknown definitions only once (the first appearance) or at every appearance of the word
- Implement a better filter for words (current one not very clever I guess)
