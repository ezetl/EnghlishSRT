- Add an option to save new words in another dictionary.
- Append new words to existing dictionary, dont write it all again and again 

- Implement an alternate way of parsing srt (without regex).
- Add option to put unknown definitions only once (the first appearance) or at every appearance of the word
- Implement a better filter for words (current one not very clever I guess)
