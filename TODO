- create a dictionary for each chapter/movie that was analyzed. Each time it has to load a dict, load it from every file in that folder.

- Option: use a database for the dictionary?
- concatenate ALL the subs, find the complete sentences and use WSD to get the right meaning (this adds complexity)
- Implement an alternate way of parsing srt (without regex).
- Implement a better filter for words (current one not very clever I guess)
