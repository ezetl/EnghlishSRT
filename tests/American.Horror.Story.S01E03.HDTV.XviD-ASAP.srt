1
00:00:16,955 --> 00:00:18,356
Mm.

2
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:20,191
Don't stop.

3
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:23,294
I'll be finished in here
in just a second.

4
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:24,865
Why?

5
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:27,487
A shame to waste
such a beautiful bed.

6
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:32,100
Don't. No, don't.
No, stop, please. No!

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,310
Stop it!
You're drunk.

8
00:00:34,378 --> 00:00:36,145
Please, I really need this job.

9
00:00:36,213 --> 00:00:37,980
You liked it the last time.

10
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:40,048
That was a mistake.

11
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:41,516
I was just lonely.

12
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:42,717
Want a Camaro?

13
00:00:42,785 --> 00:00:43,809
Huh?

14
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:45,153
We got a new shipment
in yesterday.

15
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:46,521
No, I...

16
00:00:50,226 --> 00:00:52,527
Shh.

17
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:32,126
I have loved you since I was 16.

18
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:34,061
Sweetheart, please.

19
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,796
This-This didn't mean anything.

20
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:41,802
You've broken my heart
for the last time.

21
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:47,862
We were just
getting it back, Ben.

22
00:02:49,998 --> 00:02:52,366
I wanted to trust you so badly.

23
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:54,467
I was trying to protect you.

24
00:02:54,535 --> 00:02:57,203
Oh, don't try to turn this into
some kind of heroic act!

25
00:02:57,271 --> 00:02:58,504
You were scared shitless

26
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:00,406
of what I might do
if I found out about it.

27
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:02,175
How was I supposed to know
he was gonna screw up

28
00:03:02,242 --> 00:03:03,710
our investments that badly?

29
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:05,979
He's always made us money before.
Well, I am pregnant,

30
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:10,049
and I cannot live in this house
after what happened to us here!

31
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:11,951
And now you're telling me
that we have no choice,

32
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:12,953
that we're broke?

33
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,987
We're not broke.

34
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:15,421
We have money.

35
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:16,989
It's just tied up in this house.

36
00:03:17,057 --> 00:03:19,291
Once we sell it,
we can take it out.

37
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:20,626
No, no.

38
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:21,960
I-I can't wait that long.

39
00:03:22,028 --> 00:03:23,528
I-- we...

40
00:03:23,596 --> 00:03:25,463
we have to, we have to
rent a place.

41
00:03:25,531 --> 00:03:27,765
Viv, what do you want me to do?

42
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,800
I'm trying to rebuild
my practice.

43
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:31,768
We're already paying
the minimum on our cards.

44
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,002
I'll get a job.

45
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,937
To put more stress on yourself?

46
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:38,775
Fine.

47
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,911
We'll get
a studio apartment somewhere.

48
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:43,714
We can, we can swing that,
at least, at least temporarily.

49
00:03:43,782 --> 00:03:45,249
Studio apartment?

50
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:47,085
You think that's gonna
take the pressure off?

51
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:48,119
My office is here.

52
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,220
People see me here.

53
00:03:49,288 --> 00:03:51,156
Patients see me here.

54
00:03:51,224 --> 00:03:52,358
And not that many, I might add.

55
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:03,635
Honey, you're having PTSD.

56
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:04,937
This is a total

57
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:07,140
normal response.

58
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,942
We just need
to find you a therapist

59
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:10,210
that our insurance will cover.

60
00:04:10,278 --> 00:04:11,278
Right away.

61
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:23,724
Don't make me
feel like I'm crazy.

62
00:04:26,194 --> 00:04:28,528
I have an appointment
with the realtor tomorrow.

63
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:31,432
I'm gonna talk to her about
what kind of home improvements

64
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,100
we can make--
hopefully nothing too expensive,

65
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:35,703
maybe something
with the backyard.

66
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:37,305
Hopefully we can sell the place

67
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:39,040
without taking
too much of a loss.

68
00:04:39,107 --> 00:04:40,041
Sure.

69
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:43,010
I'm sure we can.

70
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:48,249
Don't lie to me again.

71
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:54,256
If you lie to me again,
we're through.

72
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:58,718

73
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:04,094
I am just horrified
for you and your family.

74
00:06:04,214 --> 00:06:06,573
I hardly know
what to say, really.

75
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,560
And I can just imagine

76
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,256
how you might be feeling
a little anxious,

77
00:06:09,376 --> 00:06:10,189
given all of this.

78
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:11,930
Nope, not anxious. Angry.

79
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:14,433
You know that's how I felt
when the boys,

80
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:15,834
you know, did what they did.

81
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:17,836
We'd gotten rather close.

82
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:21,974
They'd have me over for Bloody
Marys and omelettes on a Sunday.

83
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:24,477
So to find out what nasty
little perverts they were--

84
00:06:24,544 --> 00:06:26,011
you probably heard
about the poker

85
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,014
from the fireplace
being rammed up his...

86
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:30,683
Marcy, we have to put the house
back on the market.

87
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:33,052
And we have to make back

88
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,253
everything we put into it.

89
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:35,588
We just can't afford to take

90
00:06:35,655 --> 00:06:36,922
a bath on this.

91
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,891
You know, you might want
to adjust your expectations.

92
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,560
The housing market
is dropping daily.

93
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:43,996
And these things aren't
about to change until 2013,

94
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:45,598
when we vote that bum out.

95
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:49,436
Well, here's the bottom line:
you owe our family.

96
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:52,940
Under the law, you were
obligated to disclose

97
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:55,075
any material facts
that might have

98
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:57,243
influenced our decision
to buy this house.

99
00:06:57,311 --> 00:06:58,378
Excuse me, dear,

100
00:06:58,445 --> 00:07:00,447
but the law requires us
to disclose

101
00:07:00,514 --> 00:07:01,848
any death on the premises

102
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,116
within the last three years.

103
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:04,618
I did that.

104
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:07,687
Nobody's buying me
cooking classes, Mrs. Hormon.

105
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:07,821
Harmon.

106
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,190
Nobody's looking out for me.

107
00:07:10,257 --> 00:07:12,358
Do you know where I live?

108
00:07:12,426 --> 00:07:14,960
I live in a 350-square-foot
guest house

109
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:17,630
in Valley Village, with rats.

110
00:07:17,697 --> 00:07:19,698
I'd kill to live in this house,

111
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:21,467
regardless of the history.

112
00:07:21,535 --> 00:07:24,937
You know, you probably need
a more seasoned realtor.

113
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:26,005
Someone who specializes in...

114
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:27,507
Oh, you think you were
my first call?

115
00:07:27,574 --> 00:07:29,375
I called every realtor
in the city this morning--

116
00:07:29,443 --> 00:07:30,309
Coldwellke Banker,

117
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:31,544
Century 21.

118
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:33,112
No one will take this listing.

119
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,113
So here's the plan.

120
00:07:34,181 --> 00:07:35,582
You are going to bake cookies,

121
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:38,084
you are going to go buy
beautiful, expensive,

122
00:07:38,152 --> 00:07:40,854
fresh-cut flowers,
you are going to maybe make up

123
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:42,789
some nice stories about
all the lovely people

124
00:07:42,857 --> 00:07:43,924
who have lived here
over the years.

125
00:07:43,992 --> 00:07:45,025
You're gonna do
whatever it takes

126
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:47,795
and you are gonna sell
this house,

127
00:07:47,862 --> 00:07:50,330
and then my family and I are
gonna go live someplace safe.

128
00:07:50,398 --> 00:07:51,732
And in return for that,

129
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
I am not gonna sue you
for gross criminal negligence.

130
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:56,904
We on the same page?

131
00:07:58,607 --> 00:08:00,675
Good.

132
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:02,277
See? Somebody's looking out
for you.

133
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:07,015
It's fresh.
I just made it.

134
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:35,713
I thought I'd knock this time

135
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,249
so you didn't have
a heart attack.

136
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,384
Though Lord knows
I wish you were dead.

137
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:45,423
Do me a favor, will you?

138
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,925
Before I take this one,

139
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,927
polish it up.

140
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:52,430
Look, it's cruddy
with corrosion.

141
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,598
And you know why?

142
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,833
Because you're

143
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,002
a shitty maid.

144
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,276
Adding those
to your magpie stash?

145
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,379
Until I have a full set.

146
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:10,783
Then it's off to eBay, where
I'll make a pretty penny

147
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,519
and you'll be accused of theft.

148
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:16,788
You are a thief
of biblical proportions,

149
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,457
after all.

150
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,494
Your specialty
being weak husbands.

151
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,831
I don't want
to be here anymore!

152
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,633
I'm frightened!

153
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,101
I miss my mother!

154
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:32,704
You think I want to stay

155
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:37,174
in this world of death
and rot and regret?

156
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:39,842
Try to find some dignity
in the situation.

157
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:42,645
Move on, missy.

158
00:09:42,713 --> 00:09:43,712
I can't.

159
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,078
I want to, but I can't!

160
00:09:45,146 --> 00:09:48,680
Every time...

161
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:51,249
I find my heart

162
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:53,385
breaking just a sliver for you,

163
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:55,686
I suddenly remember,

164
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:58,388
you made this mess for yourself.

165
00:09:58,456 --> 00:10:00,823
And I also remember,

166
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,058
every time I see

167
00:10:03,126 --> 00:10:05,526
that ghostly eye,

168
00:10:05,594 --> 00:10:08,329
that I was and continue to be

169
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:11,131
a hell of a shot.

170
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:13,767
You need to pay
for what you've done.

171
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:19,807
Oh, I do.

172
00:10:19,874 --> 00:10:23,110
Every goddamn day.

173
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,114
<i>I'm at the end of my rope.</i>

174
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:34,220
He's going through with
it, and there's nothing

175
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:36,555
I can do to stop him.

176
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:39,724
We're supposed to sign the
papers next week, and that's it.

177
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:42,593
23 years gone with
the stroke of a pen.

178
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,894
I'm so upset.

179
00:10:44,962 --> 00:10:50,632
And I wonder if I'll ever be
able to love or be loved again.

180
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,402
What was the reason your husband
is seeking the divorce?

181
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,204
He says I'm very boring.

182
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:59,340
I've tried to converse with
him on a variety of subjects.

183
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,775
Sports for instance.

184
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:02,277
I even learned the names

185
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:04,446
of the football teams
he follows.

186
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:06,848
Let's see, here's the Chargers,

187
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,785
the 49ers, the
Raiders, the Seahawks

188
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:11,787
up in Seattle.
That's the West Coast.

189
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:14,422
Then the Cardinals.
They're in Arizona.

190
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,425
I memorized them... for him.

191
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:20,227
I'm very good at memorization.

192
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:22,896
I can still name the states
and all of their capitals,

193
00:11:22,963 --> 00:11:24,430
which I learned in
the sixth grade.

194
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:27,232
My memory helps with my work.

195
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,602
I'm an accountant by trade, but
I'm branching out into taxes.

196
00:12:01,394 --> 00:12:02,428
What are you doing?

197
00:12:02,495 --> 00:12:03,996
Cleaning up your mess.

198
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:05,030
My mess?

199
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:07,132
Well, it's not my blood.

200
00:12:09,335 --> 00:12:11,136
How long have you been out here?

201
00:12:11,204 --> 00:12:12,037
Long enough.

202
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:13,738
What did you see?

203
00:12:13,806 --> 00:12:15,807
Why, nothing.

204
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,010
Nothing at all,
if anyone should ask.

205
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:19,878
I'm very discrete.

206
00:12:22,581 --> 00:12:23,848
Don't worry.

207
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,551
I did this room first.

208
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:29,053
It's all ready
for your next victim.

209
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:30,454
I mean patient.

210
00:12:30,522 --> 00:12:32,222
Where's my tape recorder?
It was right here.

211
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,358
I don't know what
you're talking about.

212
00:12:34,426 --> 00:12:35,993
I never touch the things on
your desk.

213
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,961
I just get the stains.

214
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:40,364
Do you wanna make a new one?

215
00:12:40,432 --> 00:12:41,899
Get away from me.

216
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:43,000
Where is it?

217
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:44,835
Think about the blood.

218
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:46,537
Rushing.
Pumping.

219
00:12:46,604 --> 00:12:49,239
Filling you up.
Filling us both up.

220
00:12:49,307 --> 00:12:51,675
I'm done playing this game!
You're goddamn fired!

221
00:12:51,743 --> 00:12:53,777
What the hell are you doing?

222
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:01,718
I did not want to get physical
with her, but I had no choice.

223
00:13:01,786 --> 00:13:04,755
I have rebuffed every advance,
and believe me,

224
00:13:04,823 --> 00:13:07,224
there have been many,
but she just won't stop!

225
00:13:07,292 --> 00:13:10,294
Unbuttoning, and
bending over and...

226
00:13:10,362 --> 00:13:12,329
I don't mean to be presumptuous,
but my days of romance

227
00:13:12,397 --> 00:13:13,897
are long over.
Oh, please. Is that why

228
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:15,299
you prance around
in that little maid's outfit

229
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:16,800
like you're headed
to a fetish ball?

230
00:13:16,868 --> 00:13:18,602
Don't want to clean
other people's houses

231
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,204
in your own clothes, my ass.

232
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:21,839
Ben!
It's all right, Madame.

233
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:24,208
I'm not
naive to the ways of men.

234
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:26,077
Their need to objectify,
conquer.

235
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:28,579
They see what they want to see.

236
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:30,982
Women, however,
see into the soul of a person.

237
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,784
Is this what you do?

238
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:34,786
Entrap employers?

239
00:13:34,854 --> 00:13:39,059
That said, I understand
the stress you two are under.

240
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:41,261
Money, the baby, what happened
here the other night.

241
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:44,301
I don't mean to listen, but the
walls here are paper thin.

242
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:45,802
This unfortunate incident aside,

243
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,471
I am happy to work for
the two of you.

244
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:50,640
And I certainly need the money,
times are tough.

245
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,542
I'm perfectly willing to forget
the whole thing.

246
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:57,547
Well, Moira, I think maybe

247
00:13:57,615 --> 00:13:59,449
it might just be better
for you to...

248
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:00,750
Just leave?

249
00:14:00,818 --> 00:14:04,387
Just toss me out like a
piece of trash, will you?

250
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:06,389
No, you won't. Not this time.

251
00:14:06,457 --> 00:14:07,591
I deserve respect.

252
00:14:09,093 --> 00:14:12,595
If your husband lays a hand on
me again,

253
00:14:12,663 --> 00:14:14,764
or tries to fire me

254
00:14:14,832 --> 00:14:17,800
with unjust cause,
I will press charges.

255
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:26,744
I changed the sheets
in your bedroom,

256
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:28,779
fresh towels in the
downstairs bath

257
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:30,915
and Violet's.

258
00:14:30,982 --> 00:14:33,317
If you don't mind I'd like to
take a longer lunch than usual.

259
00:14:33,385 --> 00:14:35,586
I'm quite shaken.

260
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:39,290
She's lying.

261
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:43,261
I knew we shouldn't have hired her
in the first place, I knew it.

262
00:14:43,328 --> 00:14:45,196
You know what I think?

263
00:14:45,263 --> 00:14:46,464
What?

264
00:14:46,531 --> 00:14:49,867
I think your little...

265
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:53,937
indiscretion in Boston...

266
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:55,873
has really screwed you up.

267
00:14:58,076 --> 00:15:01,512
And I think you're acting
out and you're being paranoid

268
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,182
and crazy and guilty,

269
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,085
and you have to get it together.

270
00:15:07,153 --> 00:15:09,988
And we have to get
out of this house.

271
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:12,224
I'd like to do that
without a lawsuit.

272
00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:28,608
And the next stop on our
tour of departed souls--

273
00:15:28,676 --> 00:15:32,145
the gem of mid-town,
Murder House.

274
00:15:53,628 --> 00:15:56,612
Relax.
I'm not here to bust you.

275
00:15:57,302 --> 00:15:58,485
Why not?

276
00:15:58,553 --> 00:16:00,521
Because what you guys went
through last week

277
00:16:00,588 --> 00:16:03,524
can haunt you a long time.
Seriously, Dad? I'm fine.

278
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:07,128
It'll make a great
college essay one day.

279
00:16:07,196 --> 00:16:11,066
Okay. But if you ever
want to talk to somebody...

280
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:12,734
Dad...
I mean, not me.

281
00:16:12,802 --> 00:16:15,237
You know, I'm way too expensive.

282
00:16:16,706 --> 00:16:18,640
But we can find you someone.

283
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,543
Okay, thanks.

284
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,978
I'll think about it.

285
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:38,493
He's a great dad.

286
00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:40,496
He really cares.

287
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:43,899
You're lucky like that.

288
00:16:54,811 --> 00:16:56,612
Where's my tape recorder?

289
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,214
Hmm?

290
00:16:58,281 --> 00:16:59,648
I need it for my work.

291
00:16:59,716 --> 00:17:01,384
Here's your coffee, Dr. Harmon.

292
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:03,619
I don't want any damn coffee.
I want my tape recorder.

293
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:06,322
It was in my office until you
cleaned up. I need it.

294
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,025
Well, it might be down
the front of my dress.

295
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:13,530
All you have to
do is reach down

296
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:16,033
between my breasts...

297
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,936
You're sick.

298
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,174
I hope it's not a problem.

299
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,875
Your next patient
is in your office.

300
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,144
My next patient?

301
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,348
I'm sorry, I-I didn't have
anyone on my schedule...

302
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:33,418
What are you doing here?

303
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,721
This is my house!

304
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:38,658
I'm not stupid, Ben.
I saw her leave.

305
00:17:41,462 --> 00:17:43,864
I just want to talk.

306
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:46,333
Not in my house.
Jesus, Hayden, I've called you

307
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:48,201
a dozen times since
I left Boston.

308
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:50,571
You left me there, Ben.

309
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:53,240
Without a word.
By myself.

310
00:17:53,308 --> 00:17:54,609
I know, I know.

311
00:17:54,677 --> 00:17:56,578
I'm sorry, but I told you
in my messages.

312
00:17:56,645 --> 00:17:58,880
We had a home invasion here.
I had to come back.

313
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,054
Did everything go all right?

314
00:18:07,122 --> 00:18:09,790
I didn't have the abortion.
What?

315
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:12,425
I decided to keep the baby.

316
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:13,560
Our baby.

317
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:16,395
I'm moving here,
and you're paying.

318
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,731
You're going to be a
father to our child.

319
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,900
I've already started
looking for a place.

320
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:23,302
I think I
really like Marina Del Rey.

321
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,473
Hayden, you-you-you really
haven't thought this through.

322
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,075
I love my wife, my family.

323
00:18:29,143 --> 00:18:30,777
As far as support, you have
to believe me,

324
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:32,546
the move out here
took everything I had.

325
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,248
I-I don't have
the financial resources...

326
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:38,219
I'm not a whore, Ben.
I matter.

327
00:18:38,287 --> 00:18:39,387
I didn't say...
I matter!

328
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:47,528
I'm looking for
a Dr. Ben Harmon.

329
00:18:47,596 --> 00:18:49,196
That's me.

330
00:18:49,264 --> 00:18:50,764
Detective Jack Colquitt.
L.A.P.D.

331
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:52,232
I need a moment of your time.

332
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:56,569
The detective wants
to talk to me.

333
00:18:56,637 --> 00:19:00,139
Fine, meet me tomorrow at 3:00.

334
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:01,674
There's a Norms
down the street.

335
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:05,679
<i>I told the other
officer</i> <i>everything.</i>

336
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:09,583
My wife and daughter were the
ones those animals terrorized.

337
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:12,053
Sorry. That's robbery/homicide.
I'm missing persons.rs

338
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:15,190
I'm here about Sally Freeman.
She's a patient of yours.

339
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,597
Our first session was Tuesday.

340
00:19:20,664 --> 00:19:22,832
I'm sorry...
missing persons?

341
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,335
Her husband hasn't seen her.
She didn't come home last night.

342
00:19:26,403 --> 00:19:28,705
He didn't seem too concerned.

343
00:19:28,773 --> 00:19:31,775
They're getting a divorce.

344
00:19:31,843 --> 00:19:34,378
Her online calendar listed
you as a 3:00 appointment.

345
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:36,513
Did she show up?
Yes.

346
00:19:36,581 --> 00:19:38,348
Then you were the last one
who saw her.

347
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,885
She also had a Power Point class
down at the Learning Annex,

348
00:19:41,953 --> 00:19:43,988
but she bailed on that.

349
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:45,989
Well, I can't tell you
what we talked about,

350
00:19:46,057 --> 00:19:48,158
but I can say it
was nothing extreme.

351
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:50,728
Well, I'm not surprised.
Just between you and I,

352
00:19:50,796 --> 00:19:53,064
everyone I talked to about
that gal said she was

353
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:55,700
the most boring
person they'd ever met.

354
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,738
How the hell do you get anything
done with that thing around?

355
00:20:00,806 --> 00:20:03,007
Right?

356
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:05,008
Anyway, like I said,
it's probably nothing.

357
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:07,343
But if you hear anything,
give me a call?

358
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:09,579
Sure.
No problem.

359
00:20:09,646 --> 00:20:11,814
I'll let myself out.

360
00:20:11,882 --> 00:20:13,182
Hopefully run into your maid.

361
00:20:24,427 --> 00:20:25,827
Change your mind?

362
00:20:25,895 --> 00:20:26,862
No.

363
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:28,864
No...

364
00:20:28,932 --> 00:20:30,633
I told you I ain't no faggot.

365
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,001
That's not what your dick says.

366
00:20:38,342 --> 00:20:40,210
Easy, man.

367
00:20:40,277 --> 00:20:43,446
You were cruisin' me, I
thought you were fair game.

368
00:20:43,514 --> 00:20:45,948
Cr sin' you, my ass.
Easy!

369
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:48,117
Help! Help!

370
00:20:48,185 --> 00:20:50,319
God!

371
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:58,494
<i>Sal Mineo was 37 years old</i>
<i>when he died.</i>

372
00:20:58,562 --> 00:21:00,996
<i>A Golden Globe winner</i>
<i>and two-time Oscar nominee.</i>

373
00:21:01,064 --> 00:21:03,266
<i>His father was a coffin-maker</i>

374
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,934
<i>who never accepted</i>
<i>that his son was gay.</i>

375
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,669
<i>They sent away</i>
<i>a petty criminal,</i>

376
00:21:06,737 --> 00:21:08,537
<i>African-American Lionel Raymond</i>
<i>Williams for the murder,</i>

377
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:11,140
<i>calling it</i>
<i>a "robbery gone wrong."</i>

378
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,443
But you'll have a hard time
finding anyone

379
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:15,145
who believes that in this town.

380
00:21:15,212 --> 00:21:18,714
Most people believe Sal Mineo
died of a hate crime.

381
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:21,517
Our tour concludes with one of
the most famous houses

382
00:21:21,585 --> 00:21:24,330
of horrors
in the City of Angels...

383
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,057
better known as
the "Murder House."

384
00:21:32,928 --> 00:21:36,330
<i>Built in 1922 by</i>
<i>Dr. Charles Montgomery--</i>

385
00:21:36,397 --> 00:21:39,899
<i>acclaimed surgeon to</i>
<i>the stars -- for his wife Nora,</i>

386
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,001
<i>a prominent East Coast</i>
<i>socialite.</i>

387
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:44,270
Charles? <i>But when Montgomery
fell on</i> <i>hard times,</i>

388
00:21:44,338 --> 00:21:47,207
<i>he became addicted to drugs</i>

389
00:21:47,274 --> 00:21:50,910
<i>and developed a terrifying</i>
<i>Frankenstein complex.</i>

390
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,011
Charles?

391
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:55,447
Charles?

392
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,927
Damn it, Charles,

393
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:10,196
are you down
in the basement again?

394
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:11,598
Charles?

395
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:14,334
For God's sake, I'm working!

396
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:16,470
Working. I wish.

397
00:22:16,538 --> 00:22:17,805
Now, come upstairs for dinner.

398
00:22:17,873 --> 00:22:18,807
You've made us wait
five whole minutes.

399
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:28,917
You've ruined it.

400
00:22:41,631 --> 00:22:43,398
What have you done to that baby?

401
00:22:43,466 --> 00:22:46,568
Can't even tell if
it's a girl or a boy.

402
00:22:46,636 --> 00:22:48,303
You're a disgrace, Charles.

403
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:49,438
How you can call yourself

404
00:22:49,505 --> 00:22:52,007
a man is beyond me.

405
00:22:52,075 --> 00:22:53,475
You think I came

406
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:56,345
all the way here
from Philadelphia for this?

407
00:22:56,412 --> 00:22:57,913
This life?

408
00:22:57,981 --> 00:22:59,915
This house?

409
00:22:59,983 --> 00:23:03,785
I built you this house,
exactly the way you wanted it.

410
00:23:03,853 --> 00:23:07,055
And how many servants
do we have? Two?

411
00:23:07,123 --> 00:23:08,657
And I'm expected to do
everything else?

412
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,860
Good, Charles.

413
00:23:11,928 --> 00:23:13,128
Drink your talent away.

414
00:23:13,196 --> 00:23:15,497
You're a waste.

415
00:23:15,564 --> 00:23:18,000
Even looking at you
I'm sick to my stomach.

416
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:19,835
You'll see.

417
00:23:19,902 --> 00:23:21,870
They will write articles
about me one day

418
00:23:21,938 --> 00:23:23,239
in the <i>Boston Medical Journal.</i>

419
00:23:23,306 --> 00:23:24,206
Ha!

420
00:23:27,643 --> 00:23:29,244
Good, Charles.
Break everything.

421
00:23:37,888 --> 00:23:39,888
Daphne, when you hear
the baby crying,

422
00:23:39,956 --> 00:23:41,856
come in straight away
and take him upstairs.

423
00:23:41,924 --> 00:23:42,991
Yes, ma'am.

424
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:44,659
Yes. Oh, come here.

425
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:46,261
It's all right.

426
00:23:46,328 --> 00:23:47,395
Shh.

427
00:23:47,463 --> 00:23:48,396
It's all right.

428
00:23:48,464 --> 00:23:50,198
It's-- here, it's okay.

429
00:23:52,368 --> 00:23:54,302
They came again today--

430
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,305
the bill collectors.

431
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:00,243
Charles!

432
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,544
Do you hear me?!

433
00:24:01,612 --> 00:24:02,312
I'm not deaf!

434
00:24:03,547 --> 00:24:04,681
Would that I were.

435
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:07,784
Now, you listen to me.

436
00:24:07,852 --> 00:24:11,488
You're going to support this
family one way or the other.

437
00:24:11,555 --> 00:24:14,958
I've arranged for a girl to come
tomorrow morning with $60 cash.

438
00:24:15,026 --> 00:24:17,360
She's in trouble.

439
00:24:17,428 --> 00:24:19,729
She probably has friends.

440
00:24:19,797 --> 00:24:21,564
So you'd better not be blotto.

441
00:24:27,871 --> 00:24:31,307
Dorothy Hudson?

442
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,242
Come in, lamb.

443
00:24:36,246 --> 00:24:38,114
Right this way.

444
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,757
Such a pretty girl.

445
00:24:48,193 --> 00:24:50,328
But you can't become a legend
of the silver screen

446
00:24:50,396 --> 00:24:51,863
with an obligation
hanging on your skirt.

447
00:24:53,566 --> 00:24:55,000
Now, don't worry.

448
00:24:55,068 --> 00:24:58,270
No one will ever know.

449
00:24:58,338 --> 00:25:01,541
But we do require
payment up front.

450
00:25:07,414 --> 00:25:08,547
Here.

451
00:25:08,615 --> 00:25:09,848
Drink this.

452
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:12,417
That's it.

453
00:25:12,485 --> 00:25:15,420
It'll make you forget.

454
00:25:15,488 --> 00:25:17,022
Charles?
You ready for Dorothy?

455
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,356
Yes, dear.

456
00:25:18,424 --> 00:25:19,657
You'll have to help her down.

457
00:25:19,725 --> 00:25:21,126
She's a bit woozy.

458
00:25:21,193 --> 00:25:23,027
Hurry. Before
it wears off.

459
00:25:31,037 --> 00:25:32,437
An estimated
two dozen girls

460
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:34,272
went under
Dr. Montgomery's knife,

461
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,308
thanks to his wife Nora.

462
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:37,976
But the souls of
the little ones

463
00:25:38,044 --> 00:25:39,444
must have weighed
heavily upon them,

464
00:25:39,512 --> 00:25:41,780
as their reign
of terror climaxed

465
00:25:41,848 --> 00:25:45,417
in a shocking finale in 1926.

466
00:25:53,194 --> 00:25:54,828
You can't go in there, ma'am!

467
00:25:54,895 --> 00:25:56,797
This is my house!

468
00:26:03,883 --> 00:26:05,389
Okay.

469
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:10,725
So, mother looks good,
uterus looks good,

470
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:12,196
baby looks good.

471
00:26:12,316 --> 00:26:13,416
So, I didn't have a miscarriage.

472
00:26:13,536 --> 00:26:14,936
Nope. Just a little spotting.

473
00:26:15,056 --> 00:26:17,011
- The bleeding stopped after a few minutes?
- Yep.

474
00:26:17,514 --> 00:26:18,719
Right after I went
into the house.

475
00:26:18,832 --> 00:26:19,999
When you're pregnant,

476
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:22,568
you have 50% more blood
in your body.

477
00:26:22,636 --> 00:26:24,571
A little discharge
is perfectly normal.

478
00:26:24,638 --> 00:26:27,173
So if this happens again,
I don't need to worry?

479
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:28,374
No worrying.

480
00:26:28,442 --> 00:26:31,378
Worrying is bad
for mommy and baby.

481
00:26:31,445 --> 00:26:33,980
Uh-oh.

482
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:35,849
Have you been worrying
more than usual?

483
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:38,919
Recently we had some, uh, issues

484
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:40,388
in our house,
but we're putting it

485
00:26:40,456 --> 00:26:41,589
on the market, so...

486
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:43,158
Read my lips.

487
00:26:43,225 --> 00:26:47,496
No moving while you're pregnant.

488
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,764
Death, divorce,

489
00:26:48,832 --> 00:26:50,132
moving--

490
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,468
these are the three
most stressful events

491
00:26:52,536 --> 00:26:54,037
a person can experience.

492
00:26:54,104 --> 00:26:58,809
We don't want any CRH,
corticotropin-releasing hormone,

493
00:26:58,877 --> 00:27:00,311
wreaking havoc in there.

494
00:27:00,379 --> 00:27:01,679
High levels could lead to

495
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:03,914
a spontaneous abortion.

496
00:27:03,982 --> 00:27:05,449
Excuse me.

497
00:27:05,517 --> 00:27:06,750
Um, one second.

498
00:27:06,818 --> 00:27:07,985
Are you all right?

499
00:27:08,053 --> 00:27:09,387
Yeah, I'm just...

500
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:10,421
Ben!

501
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:12,423
He's not the first father

502
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:13,825
to faint in here.

503
00:27:13,892 --> 00:27:14,926
Ben.

504
00:27:14,994 --> 00:27:16,361
Ben, we're gonna run a quick

505
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:18,963
EKG and a blood panel,
make sure nothing's wrong.

506
00:27:19,031 --> 00:27:21,632
And then I think
the two of you should go out

507
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,333
for a nice big lunch.

508
00:27:23,401 --> 00:27:24,668
I'm good.

509
00:27:24,736 --> 00:27:25,969
I'm good. I'm fine.

510
00:28:00,905 --> 00:28:03,073
Good luck selling this lemon.

511
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:11,415
I like it when you don't run.

512
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:12,516
Makes it a whole lot easier

513
00:28:12,584 --> 00:28:13,751
to keep up.

514
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:15,419
Leave me alone.

515
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:17,454
Hey, will you run this scene
with me while we walk?

516
00:28:17,522 --> 00:28:18,756
You be Oscar.

517
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:19,957
I'm not running lines with you.

518
00:28:20,024 --> 00:28:21,024
I'm not speaking to you.

519
00:28:21,092 --> 00:28:22,626
Ooh, someone's cranky.

520
00:28:22,694 --> 00:28:25,162
I'm guessing that trouble
in Boston didn't go so well.

521
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,564
That girl still
giving you grief?

522
00:28:26,632 --> 00:28:27,899
It's none of your business.

523
00:28:27,966 --> 00:28:29,333
My life is
none of your business.

524
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:30,735
Fine. You need
some space.

525
00:28:30,802 --> 00:28:32,336
I get it.

526
00:28:32,404 --> 00:28:34,539
I need, uh, I need $1,000.

527
00:28:34,606 --> 00:28:36,273
You're crazy.
I'm not giving you any money.

528
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:37,975
I need it. I
need head shots.

529
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:38,976
Listen to me.

530
00:28:39,043 --> 00:28:40,444
Don't come near me!

531
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,179
You bother me again,
there's gonna be a problem.

532
00:28:42,246 --> 00:28:43,113
You understand?

533
00:28:46,384 --> 00:28:48,218
Oh, I understand.

534
00:29:07,505 --> 00:29:10,305
You won't find
any gold buried out here.

535
00:29:12,976 --> 00:29:15,744
What are you doing
down there in the dirt?

536
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:19,614
I don't know.

537
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:22,350
I keep finding myself
waking up here.

538
00:29:22,418 --> 00:29:24,552
The same spot.

539
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,055
Well, there's no mystery to it.

540
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:28,290
It's stress.

541
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:30,526
Teenage daughter...

542
00:29:30,593 --> 00:29:32,461
a pregnant wife,

543
00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:35,765
and your business hasn't
found its footing yet.

544
00:29:35,832 --> 00:29:40,569
I can tell by the cars
on the street, or lack thereof.

545
00:29:40,637 --> 00:29:42,972
But you'll find your way.

546
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,007
Mm-mm.

547
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,342
I must warn you
about this property.

548
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,410
You see, the previous owners

549
00:29:49,478 --> 00:29:52,246
soaked this ground
in pesticides.

550
00:29:52,314 --> 00:29:56,283
Any fruit from this soil
would be poison.

551
00:29:56,351 --> 00:29:58,318
With soil this toxic,

552
00:29:58,385 --> 00:30:01,754
the best you can do
is just to cover it up.

553
00:30:03,824 --> 00:30:06,393
You know, I see a brick patio

554
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:08,396
with a gazebo

555
00:30:08,464 --> 00:30:10,431
under the shade
of this pepper tree.

556
00:30:10,499 --> 00:30:13,702
Tall glass of Long Island
iced tea in your hand

557
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,373
while reclining
on a chaise lounge.

558
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,443
Oh, the sweet hum
of cicadas in your ears.

559
00:30:21,812 --> 00:30:22,978
Heaven.

560
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,888
Sheer heaven.

561
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:55,309
Can I help you?

562
00:30:55,376 --> 00:30:56,743
Are you the woman of the house?

563
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:58,812
Are you here
to look at the house?

564
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:00,480
Did you have an appointment?

565
00:31:00,547 --> 00:31:01,781
Yes.

566
00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:03,850
Well, you'll have to call
the realtor.

567
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:05,384
I can come back another time.

568
00:31:10,423 --> 00:31:12,490
Wait.

569
00:31:16,494 --> 00:31:18,362
My husband's upstairs, so...

570
00:31:24,035 --> 00:31:26,805
Oh, this wood--

571
00:31:26,872 --> 00:31:29,608
it's so lovely and warm.

572
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:31,343
One almost never sees
chestnut anymore.

573
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:32,711
Yeah, I know.

574
00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:34,480
I never even knew
what kind of wood this was.

575
00:31:34,548 --> 00:31:37,049
And the wainscot here.

576
00:31:38,485 --> 00:31:40,186
Louis Comfort Tiffany glass.

577
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:41,754
Yes.

578
00:31:41,822 --> 00:31:44,724
Inspired by the iridescence
of butterfly wings.

579
00:31:44,792 --> 00:31:46,426
And look at the blue.

580
00:31:46,494 --> 00:31:48,128
Matches my eyes, doesn't it?

581
00:31:48,196 --> 00:31:49,996
It does.

582
00:31:50,064 --> 00:31:52,932
Your eyes are
a beautiful blue, too.

583
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,300
Thank you.

584
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:56,802
And this must be
one of the chandeliers

585
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,504
imported from his
studio in New York.

586
00:31:58,571 --> 00:32:00,005
Yes.

587
00:32:00,073 --> 00:32:02,074
I looked it up,
it's the real deal.

588
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:05,010
The house has four of them.

589
00:32:05,078 --> 00:32:06,879
Would you like
to look at the kitchen?

590
00:32:09,182 --> 00:32:10,950
It's been modernized
quite a bit.

591
00:32:15,088 --> 00:32:16,589
I don't like this.
It's not right.

592
00:32:16,657 --> 00:32:18,691
It's not what I want.

593
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:19,825
What's that device?

594
00:32:21,028 --> 00:32:22,529
Oh, this?

595
00:32:22,596 --> 00:32:25,131
This is, um,
this is a pasta arm.

596
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:28,267
It's-It's, you know, for
filling up big pots of water.

597
00:32:28,335 --> 00:32:29,435
I'll tell you what.

598
00:32:29,503 --> 00:32:31,070
If you decide
you want the house,

599
00:32:31,138 --> 00:32:33,239
I will have this removed
before you move in.

600
00:32:33,307 --> 00:32:36,409
Do you think I could have
a glass of water?

601
00:32:36,477 --> 00:32:38,278
Yeah.

602
00:32:38,346 --> 00:32:39,880
Or would you like some tea?

603
00:32:39,948 --> 00:32:41,949
I-I was making tea before--
mint and verbena.

604
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,454
Ugh.

605
00:32:47,522 --> 00:32:49,422
I would have to get
rid of that machine.

606
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,423
Oh, I know.

607
00:32:50,491 --> 00:32:51,758
I'm conflicted about it, too.

608
00:32:51,826 --> 00:32:54,194
We are just addicted

609
00:32:54,262 --> 00:32:56,329
to our conveniences.
We?

610
00:32:58,399 --> 00:32:59,766
Do you have children?

611
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:02,235
Yep. I have a daughter.

612
00:33:02,303 --> 00:33:04,805
And actually, I'm pregnant

613
00:33:04,872 --> 00:33:07,274
at the moment.
Pregnant?

614
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:12,947
I had a child.

615
00:33:31,187 --> 00:33:33,221
Dr. Harmon.

616
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:35,251
A little late to be planting,
isn't it?

617
00:33:35,371 --> 00:33:36,327
How can I help you, Detective?

618
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,438
We found Sally Freeman.

619
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:39,507
She had something of
yours on her person.

620
00:33:39,858 --> 00:33:43,164
Sally was admitted to University
Hospital two days ago.

621
00:33:43,232 --> 00:33:46,289
Failed suicide attempt,
found in a hotel downtown.

622
00:33:46,388 --> 00:33:48,923
She took one too many
pills, put herself in a coma.

623
00:33:49,477 --> 00:33:50,977
She was brought in
without an I.D.,

624
00:33:51,045 --> 00:33:53,080
which is why it took awhile
to find her in the system.

625
00:33:53,147 --> 00:33:55,061
Could have saved a lot of people
a lot of trouble

626
00:33:55,181 --> 00:33:58,920
if you told us.
I'm bound under doctor-patient confidentiality.

627
00:33:58,988 --> 00:34:03,425
Who are you trying to protect,
Doc-- Sally Freeman, or you?

628
00:34:03,492 --> 00:34:05,661
You're worse than my husband.

629
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:08,730
I'm paying you to help me
through this crisis.

630
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:11,734
The least you can do is pretend
to be interested.

631
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:13,602
I'm in pain.

632
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:17,654
I'm in pain! What do I have to
do to get your attention?!

633
00:34:17,911 --> 00:34:19,537
Kill myself?!

634
00:34:23,746 --> 00:34:25,046
Stop.

635
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:26,481
Finally.

636
00:34:26,549 --> 00:34:29,417
I got a rise.
Now I know what I have to do.

637
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,021
I didn't do anything.

638
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:36,358
You heard it on the tape.

639
00:34:36,426 --> 00:34:37,826
She did it to herself.

640
00:34:37,894 --> 00:34:39,561
Right.

641
00:34:41,064 --> 00:34:42,531
It's not a crime
to be an asshole.

642
00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:50,139
So as I mentioned on the phone,

643
00:34:50,207 --> 00:34:52,675
the carpet will be steam clean
before move in.

644
00:34:52,742 --> 00:34:56,979
There's a dock there for your
iPod or your iWhatever.

645
00:34:57,047 --> 00:34:59,315
Uh, well, I'll tell you
what I do like.

646
00:34:59,382 --> 00:35:01,384
I like that security
guy at the door...

647
00:35:01,452 --> 00:35:04,153
Excuse me. Can my mom and I have
a moment? Alone?

648
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:06,355
Sure.

649
00:35:06,423 --> 00:35:07,690
I'll be in the rental office.

650
00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:10,826
I've got someone else coming
in 20 minutes.

651
00:35:10,894 --> 00:35:13,896
Glad we moved all
the way to California,

652
00:35:13,964 --> 00:35:16,932
since we could be totally anywhere.
I think it has a certain...

653
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:19,267
You and Dad, both of you--
you don't deal with anything.

654
00:35:19,335 --> 00:35:20,669
The affair, the miscarriage.

655
00:35:20,736 --> 00:35:22,904
For most people that's
just life and they deal.

656
00:35:22,972 --> 00:35:25,406
But you guys had
to uproot everything--

657
00:35:25,474 --> 00:35:27,709
drag everyone across the country
to start all over...

658
00:35:27,776 --> 00:35:30,112
Honey, I don't think you've
quite processed

659
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:32,281
what happened to us
in that house.

660
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:35,885
That was devastating.
That was a nightmare.

661
00:35:35,953 --> 00:35:37,887
This place is the nightmare.

662
00:35:37,955 --> 00:35:39,722
I love our house, it's got soul.

663
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,791
It's where you and I
kicked some ass, Mom.

664
00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:44,594
You say we were victims
of something bad there.

665
00:35:44,661 --> 00:35:46,295
I say that's the place
where we survived.

666
00:35:46,363 --> 00:35:47,930
I love that you see it that way.

667
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,334
I'm pregnant.

668
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:54,303
I can't stay there.

669
00:35:54,371 --> 00:35:58,041
This is the decision that
your father and I have made

670
00:35:58,109 --> 00:35:59,309
for our family together.

671
00:35:59,376 --> 00:36:01,211
Yeah, whatever.

672
00:36:01,278 --> 00:36:03,813
But I'm telling you,
you go ahead

673
00:36:03,881 --> 00:36:05,915
with this whacked-out plan
and I'm out of here.

674
00:36:05,982 --> 00:36:07,917
I will run away.

675
00:36:07,984 --> 00:36:11,855
And believe me, I know how to
leave so you will never find me.

676
00:36:16,629 --> 00:36:19,131
I'm looking at your
results and the good news is

677
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:21,300
your EKG is perfectly normal.

678
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:24,370
As for your blood panel, they
found a laudanum compound.

679
00:36:24,438 --> 00:36:26,139
Laudanum?

680
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:29,509
Apparently they used to use it
as an opiate during surgery.

681
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,478
But it caused such extreme
retrograde memory loss,

682
00:36:32,546 --> 00:36:35,014
that they banned it in 1934.

683
00:36:35,082 --> 00:36:37,217
Uh, excuse me one second.
I'll call you right back.

684
00:36:39,353 --> 00:36:41,287
I know you drugged my coffee.

685
00:36:41,355 --> 00:36:42,988
Prove it.

686
00:36:48,149 --> 00:36:48,886
Hey.

687
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:50,864
Jesus, I am so sorry...

688
00:36:50,932 --> 00:36:52,800
You left me waiting in
the Norms for three hours?!

689
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:53,934
Mrs. Harmon?!

690
00:36:54,002 --> 00:36:56,137
Hayden, hey.
Mrs. Harmon!

691
00:36:56,204 --> 00:36:57,672
It's Hayden McClaine!
We need to talk!

692
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,940
Hayden, stop.
This is crazy.

693
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,009
Vivien?
You're acting crazy.

694
00:37:01,077 --> 00:37:03,312
Do not call me crazy.
I am not crazy. Calm down.

695
00:37:03,379 --> 00:37:05,147
I'm angry.
Calm down.

696
00:37:05,215 --> 00:37:06,815
And I'm pregnant!
Mrs. Harmon?!

697
00:37:06,883 --> 00:37:10,285
Do not put your hands on me!

698
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,553
You're upset.

699
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:14,822
You have every right to be,
but before this spins

700
00:37:14,889 --> 00:37:17,057
completely out of control,
let's go someplace and talk.

701
00:37:17,124 --> 00:37:18,425
Vivien needs to know.

702
00:37:18,492 --> 00:37:21,695
She needs to understand
you have other obligations.

703
00:37:21,762 --> 00:37:24,264
I think we should tell
her together.

704
00:37:24,331 --> 00:37:26,833
We can discuss that, too.

705
00:37:26,901 --> 00:37:29,770
I'm not going back
to that Norms.

706
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:31,005
Anywhere you like.

707
00:37:34,743 --> 00:37:38,146
Well, I am eating for two.

708
00:37:58,135 --> 00:38:00,670
You know what I'd love?

709
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:02,639
A big, thick, juicy...

710
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:05,509
She's still moving.

711
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:09,646
What the hell have you done?!

712
00:38:11,883 --> 00:38:15,585
What'd you do?! What'd you do?!
What'd you do?!

713
00:38:15,653 --> 00:38:17,687
Easy!

714
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:19,422
So far you haven't
killed anybody!

715
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,129
Yeah. She's done.

716
00:38:26,197 --> 00:38:28,565
Oh, God! Oh, God!

717
00:38:30,334 --> 00:38:31,767
What are you doing?

718
00:38:31,835 --> 00:38:33,469
You taking a DNA bath?

719
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:37,106
She's dead.
Uh-huh.

720
00:38:37,174 --> 00:38:38,574
You're a murderer.

721
00:38:38,642 --> 00:38:39,876
You're a murderer!

722
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:42,345
Yeah. But you're not.

723
00:38:42,413 --> 00:38:45,080
And now all your
problems are solved.

724
00:38:45,148 --> 00:38:46,582
She was going to tell
Vivien everything.

725
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:47,716
We couldn't have that.

726
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,319
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna
call the police.

727
00:38:50,387 --> 00:38:52,321
You, uh, you sure you
want to do that?

728
00:38:52,389 --> 00:38:55,791
I mean, she was
your mistress, Ben.

729
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,293
And she was carrying your baby.
I mean, how's that gonna look?

730
00:38:58,361 --> 00:39:00,195
I just don't see that
going well for you.

731
00:39:00,263 --> 00:39:02,799
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay. Oh, God.

732
00:39:02,866 --> 00:39:05,335
Everything's gonna be...

733
00:39:05,403 --> 00:39:09,406
You just got to get yourself cleaned
up before your wife gets back.

734
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:11,509
Oh, God...
I'll take care of the body.

735
00:39:11,576 --> 00:39:13,911
It's not a problem.

736
00:39:19,052 --> 00:39:21,854
Hey, hey... hey... what were
you digging up here?

737
00:39:23,724 --> 00:39:25,525
You got a nice good
hole started here. See?

738
00:39:25,593 --> 00:39:26,626
We're halfway there.

739
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,397
Hey, Ben?

740
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:34,334
I could really use
that thousand bucks.
