I got her cooking lessons

Aren't you a psychologist?
Psychiatrist.

about there being a study

as a home office?

00:10:09,954 --> 00:10:13,023
Violet, honey, would you go see
where Hayley went? Thank you.

168
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:16,360
What are you yapping at?

169
00:10:25,403 --> 00:10:27,837
(door sticking)

170
00:10:31,076 --> 00:10:33,043
(door creaking)

171
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:34,946
(steps creaking)

172
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:01,540
BEN: <i>When I saw the pictures</i>
<i>of this room online,</i>

173
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:03,242
<i>I thought maybe</i>
<i>you could use it</i>

174
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,643
as your music room.

175
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:06,078
Are you a musician?

176
00:11:06,146 --> 00:11:07,179
I was.

177
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:08,947
Cellist--
very good one, in fact.

178
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:10,182
Why did you quit?

179
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:12,750
This wallpaper
is peeling over here.

180
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:14,653
Looks like maybe there's a mural

181
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
underneath it.

182
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:17,489
The last owners probably

183
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:18,557
covered it up.

184
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,624
They were modernists.

185
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:20,825
Speaking of the last owners,

186
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:24,029
full disclosure requires
that I tell you

187
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:25,330
about what happened to them.

188
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:27,132
Oh, God...

189
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:29,434
they didn't die in here
or anything, did they?

190
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:30,535
Yes, actually, both of them.

191
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:32,704
Murder-suicide.

192
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:34,940
I sold them the house, too.

193
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:37,108
They were just the
sweetest couple.

194
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:38,977
You never know, I guess.
BEN: That explains why

195
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:40,111
it's half the price
of every other house

196
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:41,579
in the neighborhood, I guess.

197
00:11:41,647 --> 00:11:44,916
I do have a very nice
mid-century ranch, but it's

198
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:46,184
in the Valley, and
you're going to get

199
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:47,586
a third of the house
for twice the price.

200
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:48,620
Right.

201
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:49,687
Where did it happen?

202
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:51,055
The basement.

203
00:11:51,123 --> 00:11:52,657
We'll take it.

204
00:12:08,037 --> 00:12:09,871
BEN:
<i>Come on, babe,</i>

205
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:10,772
let's go to bed.

206
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,407
Leave that for the morning.

207
00:12:12,474 --> 00:12:14,175
I'm a little bit
worried about Violet,

208
00:12:14,243 --> 00:12:16,577
you know, these kids
here are very different.

209
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:19,213
I don't know if she can handle
another year of not fitting in.

210
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,215
You mean... you can't?

211
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:26,020
Can't believe this place doesn't
freak you out a little bit.

212
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:27,221
'Cause of what happened here?

213
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,656
My repulsion is tempered
by the fact

214
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:31,159
that this house is worth four
times what we paid for it,

215
00:12:31,227 --> 00:12:33,762
so let's not think about it.

216
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,631
This is your professional
advice, Doctor,

217
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:37,066
just denial?

218
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:41,705
Come on, let me give you
a little love.

219
00:12:41,773 --> 00:12:44,208
Moving here, buying this house

220
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:46,743
was the exact right thing to do

221
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:50,013
for us and our family.

222
00:12:51,182 --> 00:12:52,882
It's a good thing

223
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,017
and we deserve some good
after all the shit

224
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:56,719
we've been through.

225
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:04,959
I've got some
stuff I want to...

226
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:07,695
unpack down in the kitchen.

227
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:14,470
I appreciate
that you're trying.

228
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:19,342
I'm trying, too.

229
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:23,147
Okay.

230
00:13:23,215 --> 00:13:25,016
It's just gonna take some time.

231
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,600
LEAH:
So I let him.

232
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:45,535
Do coke off your nipples?

233
00:13:45,603 --> 00:13:47,738
They were numb
for, like, two days.

234
00:13:47,805 --> 00:13:48,806
Hey!

235
00:13:48,873 --> 00:13:50,541
Student council passed a rule

236
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:52,009
against smoking
in public spaces.

237
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:53,110
Secondhand smoke kills.

238
00:13:53,178 --> 00:13:55,279
I'm new, I didn't know.

239
00:13:55,346 --> 00:13:57,914
What the hell is
wrong with you?

240
00:13:57,982 --> 00:14:00,350
People sit here, they eat here.

241
00:14:00,418 --> 00:14:02,018
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

242
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:03,453
Leah's grandmother died
of lung cancer.

243
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:05,321
She takes this stuff
pretty seriously.

244
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:08,324
Eat it-- eat it or I'm gonna
kick the shit out of you.

245
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:10,193
No.
What? Come on, Leah, that's enough.

246
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,661
No, no, no, I want to see her eat it.
No.

247
00:14:12,729 --> 00:14:14,997
No. Eat it, eat it.
Leah, seriously, she's like 12.

248
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:16,832
(spits)
(screams)

249
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,636
(screeching):
You are dead! You are dead!

250
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:26,575
Whoo!

251
00:14:26,643 --> 00:14:28,762
ADELAIDE: You're going to die in here.
(screams)

252
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,579
Who are you? What are you doing?

253
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:31,547
What are you doing here?

254
00:14:31,614 --> 00:14:33,649
CONSTANCE:
Adelaide.

255
00:14:33,717 --> 00:14:34,550
Adelaide.

256
00:14:36,152 --> 00:14:37,852
Adelaide.

257
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,490
Adelaide, I put on
<i>Dora the Explorer</i> for you,

258
00:14:42,558 --> 00:14:43,959
so you would sit and watch it.

259
00:14:44,026 --> 00:14:45,160
It was <i>Go, Diego, Go!</i>

260
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:46,628
I don't like it.

261
00:14:46,695 --> 00:14:48,529
Oh, brown cartoon characters--
you can't tell the difference.

262
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:49,831
Excuse me.

263
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:50,998
Hi.

264
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:52,366
Hi.

265
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,734
I'm Constance, your neighbor
from next door,

266
00:14:54,802 --> 00:14:57,203
and this is my girl Adelaide.

267
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,272
Hello.
Go home,

268
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,207
Addy, now.

269
00:15:03,543 --> 00:15:04,910
That girl is a monster.

270
00:15:04,978 --> 00:15:07,313
I love her
and I'm a good Christian,

271
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,081
but Jesus H. Christ.

272
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:11,150
You know, if they had invented
some of those tests

273
00:15:11,218 --> 00:15:12,418
a few years ago,
I would have...

274
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:14,220
How'd you get into my house?

275
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,656
You left your back door open.

276
00:15:16,724 --> 00:15:18,992
Although I have to tell you,
Addy will always

277
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,494
find a way in.

278
00:15:20,562 --> 00:15:24,398
She has a bug up her ass
about this house, always has.

279
00:15:25,768 --> 00:15:27,135
You have the loveliest things.

280
00:15:27,202 --> 00:15:28,769
Thank you.

281
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:31,372
Have you got a dog?
I-I do have a dog, yes.

282
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,373
I run a little kennel
out of my house,

283
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:35,208
doggy day care kind of a thing.

284
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:36,209
How nice.

285
00:15:36,277 --> 00:15:38,378
Well, I prefer purebreds.

286
00:15:38,445 --> 00:15:41,113
I adore the beauty
of a long line,

287
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:43,649
but there's always room

288
00:15:43,716 --> 00:15:46,418
in my home for mongrels.

289
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,557
Oh...

290
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,658
Oh, my.

291
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:55,228
Look at those earrings.

292
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:58,097
Are those real diamonds?

293
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,333
Not that Home Shopping shit.

294
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:01,468
No.

295
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:03,871
I used to have
diamonds like that.

296
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:06,808
Different pair for
every day of the week.

297
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:07,842
Did your husband
give them to you?

298
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,910
He did.

299
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:10,112
Hmm?
Mm-hmm.

300
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:13,182
They always do when
you're young and pretty.

301
00:16:15,953 --> 00:16:17,587
Are you Southern?

302
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:19,623
Proud Virginian.

303
00:16:19,691 --> 00:16:22,893
The Old Dominion,
born and bred.

304
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:24,762
Thank you for noticing.

305
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,497
I came out here
to be a movie star.

306
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:31,601
Did the screen tests
and everything, but...

307
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:34,238
nudity was the big deal then.

308
00:16:34,306 --> 00:16:36,573
The morals were
just beginning to collapse,

309
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:39,877
and I wasn't about to have
my green pasture

310
00:16:39,944 --> 00:16:41,111
flashed 70 feet high

311
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:44,347
for every man, woman,
and child to see,

312
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:49,052
so I took that little butterfly
of a dream

313
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,322
and put it in a jar
on the shelf,

314
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:56,060
and, uh, soon after,
came the Mongoloid

315
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:58,629
and, of course,
I couldn't work after that.

316
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:02,199
It has been so great
to meet you.

317
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:04,702
I just-- you know,

318
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:06,871
I wasn't prepared
for guests at all.

319
00:17:06,938 --> 00:17:09,773
I'm gone.

320
00:17:09,841 --> 00:17:10,975
Oh, I brought you this.

321
00:17:12,243 --> 00:17:13,777
You know, a little, um,

322
00:17:13,844 --> 00:17:15,478
housewarming.
Thank you.

323
00:17:16,714 --> 00:17:18,815
Addy wanted to bake you a pie,

324
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:21,418
but she tends to
spit in the cooking,

325
00:17:21,486 --> 00:17:23,320
so I thought this
would be better.

326
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:25,521
Help get rid of some
of that bad juju.

327
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:29,225
I don't remember your name.

328
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:32,361
Right, no, I never got
a chance to tell you my name.

329
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:34,397
Oh.
My name is Vivien Harmon.

330
00:17:34,464 --> 00:17:36,332
Anyway...

331
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,033
relax and enjoy.

332
00:17:38,101 --> 00:17:41,169
Let me know if you need
any help with that pup.

333
00:17:41,237 --> 00:17:42,938
Will do.

334
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:45,373
I'm glad you're getting rid
of that wallpaper.

335
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:47,575
I thought those people
were supposed to be stylish.

336
00:17:53,582 --> 00:17:54,882
It's sage...

337
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,119
for cleansing the spirits
in the house.

338
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,722
Too many bad memories in here.

339
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,224
(door creaks open)

340
00:18:12,835 --> 00:18:15,604
(wind whistling)

341
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:39,428
(Vivien screams)

342
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:42,597
What happened?

343
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:44,265
You okay?

344
00:18:47,236 --> 00:18:51,507
Oh, I guess these guys were
into the kinky stuff, huh?

345
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:52,542
Would you like to try it on?

346
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,576
That's not funny.

347
00:18:53,644 --> 00:18:54,745
I think you'd look good in it.

348
00:18:55,647 --> 00:18:57,281
What happened?

349
00:18:58,383 --> 00:19:00,218
Holy shit.
Let's get rid of it.

350
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:01,519
Come on, let's go downstairs.

351
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:02,520
Come on.

352
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:04,923
Watch the steps.

353
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:13,330
BEN: So, Tate,
these fantasies started

354
00:19:13,398 --> 00:19:16,633
two years ago,
three years ago, when?

355
00:19:16,701 --> 00:19:17,634
Two years ago.

356
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:18,901
It's always the same.

357
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:20,570
It starts the same way.

358
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:21,771
How? Tell me.

359
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,106
I prepare for the noble war.

360
00:19:24,174 --> 00:19:26,475
("Twisted Nerve"
by Bernard Herrmann playing)

361
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:31,581
<i>I'm calm, I know the secret,</i>
<i>I know what's coming,</i>

362
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:34,585
<i>and I know no one can stop me,</i>
<i>including myself.</i>

363
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:35,786
BEN: <i>Do you target people</i>
<i>who have been</i>

364
00:19:35,854 --> 00:19:37,855
mean to you or unkind?

365
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:39,123
I kill people I like.

366
00:19:47,668 --> 00:19:49,535
Can I help you?

367
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:52,939
Some of them beg for their life.

368
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:53,840
I don't feel sad.

369
00:19:53,908 --> 00:19:55,141
I don't feel anything.

370
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:56,876
It's a filthy world we live in.

371
00:19:56,944 --> 00:19:59,546
It's a filthy goddamn
helpless world,

372
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:01,814
and honestly, I feel like
I'm helping to take them away

373
00:20:01,882 --> 00:20:03,249
from the shit

374
00:20:03,317 --> 00:20:05,852
and the piss and the vomit
that run in the streets.

375
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:06,786
I'm helping

376
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:08,354
to take them somewhere clean

377
00:20:08,422 --> 00:20:09,555
and kind.

378
00:20:11,258 --> 00:20:12,525
There's something

379
00:20:12,593 --> 00:20:14,894
<i>about all that blood, man.</i>

380
00:20:14,962 --> 00:20:16,529
<i>I drown in it.</i>

381
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:22,134
The Indians believed that blood
holds all the bad spirits,

382
00:20:22,202 --> 00:20:24,270
and once a month in ceremonies
they would cut themselves

383
00:20:24,337 --> 00:20:26,305
to let the spirits go free.

384
00:20:26,373 --> 00:20:27,407
There's something

385
00:20:27,474 --> 00:20:29,241
smart about that.

386
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:31,577
Very smart. I like that.

387
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:36,548
You think I'm crazy?

388
00:20:36,616 --> 00:20:37,949
No.

389
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:40,485
I think you're creative.

390
00:20:40,553 --> 00:20:42,854
And I think you have a lot
of pain you're not dealing with.

391
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:45,056
My mother's probably worried
about me, right?

392
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:46,257
I'm sure she is.

393
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:47,659
She's a cocksucker.

394
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:49,795
I mean, literally,
a cocksucker.

395
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:51,363
She used to suck the guy off
next-door, all the time.

396
00:20:51,431 --> 00:20:54,099
My dad found out, and he left.

397
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:56,002
He left me alone
with a cocksucker.

398
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,236
Can you imagine?

399
00:20:57,304 --> 00:20:58,304
How sick is that?

400
00:20:58,372 --> 00:20:59,606
I've heard a lot worse.

401
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:01,208
Cool.

402
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:02,576
Can you tell me some?

403
00:21:02,644 --> 00:21:03,777
I like stories.

404
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,514
No. I can't.

405
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:09,716
The world is a filthy place.

406
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:13,019
It's a filthy
goddamn horror show.

407
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,988
There's so much pain, you know?

408
00:21:16,056 --> 00:21:17,857
<i>There's so much.</i>

409
00:21:19,726 --> 00:21:21,159
You're doing it wrong.

410
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:23,094
If you're trying to kill
yourself, cut vertically.

411
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:25,330
They can't stitch that up.

412
00:21:25,398 --> 00:21:27,732
How'd you get in here?

413
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,102
If you're trying
to kill yourself,

414
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,338
you might also try
locking the door.

415
00:21:32,405 --> 00:21:34,273
(door creaking)

416
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:39,145
(crickets chirping)

417
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,816
(eerie, distorted whispering)

418
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:46,788
(eerie, distorted whispering)

419
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:55,196
(stairs creaking)

420
00:21:58,334 --> 00:22:00,334
(man speaking
indistinctly, distantly)

421
00:22:03,507 --> 00:22:05,809
(eerie whispering)

422
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:25,829
What are you doing?

423
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:29,967
Am I on a trip?

424
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,164
Can I help you?

425
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:42,432
I'm Moira O'Hara.

426
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,600
I'm the housekeeper.

427
00:22:43,668 --> 00:22:45,602
Oh.

428
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:47,537
I didn't know the place came
with a housekeeper.

429
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:49,338
Why are you hanging your sheets

430
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:51,207
with a perfectly good
electric dryer inside?

431
00:22:51,275 --> 00:22:53,976
I don't like all those chemicals
in the fabric softeners,

432
00:22:54,044 --> 00:22:56,212
so I just like
to do it naturally.

433
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,915
I work Monday through Thursday.

434
00:22:58,983 --> 00:23:01,185
Thanksgiving on, Christmas off.

435
00:23:01,252 --> 00:23:03,120
Um...
That was the deal with the last fellows.

436
00:23:03,188 --> 00:23:04,655
I'm sorry.
I'm just not sure

437
00:23:04,723 --> 00:23:06,557
that we're gonna need
a housekeeper.

438
00:23:08,594 --> 00:23:10,829
What have you been using
to clean the floorboards?

439
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:11,763
Murphy's Oil Soap.

440
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,530
Oh, no.

441
00:23:13,232 --> 00:23:14,499
White vinegar.

442
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,167
Oil soap kills the wood.

443
00:23:16,235 --> 00:23:17,735
I like that better.
It's more natural.

444
00:23:17,802 --> 00:23:20,637
Have you ever owned a
house this old before?

445
00:23:20,705 --> 00:23:21,605
No.

446
00:23:21,672 --> 00:23:23,473
It has a personality, feelings.

447
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,208
Mistreat it, and
you'll regret it.

448
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,410
May I come in?

449
00:23:28,478 --> 00:23:30,613
My cab's left,
and I'd like to call another.

450
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,449
So, you worked for
the previous owners?

451
00:23:33,517 --> 00:23:34,851
I've been the housekeeper
here for years.

452
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,986
They come, they go, I stay.

453
00:23:37,054 --> 00:23:38,488
They were both nice boys,

454
00:23:38,556 --> 00:23:39,589
the ones before you.

455
00:23:40,657 --> 00:23:42,024
I found the bodies.

456
00:23:42,092 --> 00:23:43,426
What happened?

457
00:23:43,494 --> 00:23:45,661
I mean, I hate to gossip...

458
00:23:45,729 --> 00:23:47,563
They fought a lot.

459
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:49,298
Money, I think.

460
00:23:49,366 --> 00:23:52,468
But who can know when something
so horrible happens?

461
00:23:52,536 --> 00:23:54,604
Sometimes people just go mad.

462
00:23:56,274 --> 00:23:58,842
I cleaned the mess.

463
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:00,744
You'd never know.

464
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,981
Can I ask you
a personal question?

465
00:24:06,784 --> 00:24:08,118
Do you ever get tired

466
00:24:08,186 --> 00:24:09,719
of cleaning up
other peoples' messes?

467
00:24:09,787 --> 00:24:11,120
We're women.
It's what we do.

468
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:13,589
I just get paid for it.

469
00:24:13,657 --> 00:24:14,724
Yes.

470
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:16,292
(footsteps approaching)

471
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,461
Oh, hey, this is
my husband Ben.

472
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:19,995
Ben, this is Moira O'Hara.

473
00:24:20,063 --> 00:24:23,132
She was the housekeeper
for the previous owner.

474
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:27,536
Nice to meet you.
(car horn honks)

475
00:24:27,604 --> 00:24:30,373
That's my cab.

476
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,442
I'll use the lavatory
first, if you don't mind.

477
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:33,409
Sure.

478
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:39,416
What do you think?

479
00:24:39,484 --> 00:24:42,219
What? You-You...
You want to hire her?

480
00:24:42,287 --> 00:24:45,389
Yeah, I mean, she's a
little kooky, but she seems

481
00:24:45,457 --> 00:24:47,593
trustworthy, she knows
the house really well,

482
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:50,263
and I feel like I
could just use the help.

483
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,131
(door creaking)

484
00:24:52,198 --> 00:24:54,200
So... can you
start tomorrow?

485
00:24:54,267 --> 00:24:55,902
Thursday's better,
but I'll make it work.

486
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:58,438
Okay. And you know, Moira,

487
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:00,773
you don't have to wear
the housekeeper's uniform.

488
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,408
You can just wear
your own clothes.

489
00:25:02,475 --> 00:25:05,210
I don't like cleaning peoples'
houses in my own clothes.

490
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:09,848
(door creaking)

491
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,283
What?

492
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,385
Nothing. Just...

493
00:25:13,452 --> 00:25:16,121
You just always surprise me.

494
00:25:16,188 --> 00:25:18,823
I like that.

495
00:25:30,834 --> 00:25:32,702
(sighs)

496
00:25:34,371 --> 00:25:36,305
You're gonna have
to forgive me one day.

497
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,881
You mind if I tape this?

498
00:25:44,949 --> 00:25:46,149
TATE:
No.

499
00:25:46,217 --> 00:25:47,983
You taking your medications?

500
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:49,318
Yes.

501
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:50,720
Any side effects?

502
00:25:50,787 --> 00:25:53,489
I was taking them at night,
but they kept me up.

503
00:25:53,557 --> 00:25:54,657
And what did you do?

504
00:25:54,725 --> 00:25:56,259
Started taking them
in the morning.

505
00:25:56,326 --> 00:25:58,295
Light sensitivity
is pretty common.

506
00:25:58,362 --> 00:25:59,663
Maybe.

507
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,964
Yeah, I think so.

508
00:26:01,032 --> 00:26:02,466
When I was in medical school,

509
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:03,967
they brought in
this CIA interrogator

510
00:26:04,035 --> 00:26:05,970
to help us better identify
who was lying.

511
00:26:06,037 --> 00:26:06,837
This guy was, like,

512
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:09,606
six foot, 50, crew cut.

513
00:26:09,674 --> 00:26:11,642
He must have been
one hell of an interrogator,

514
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,943
because I'll tell you something.

515
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:14,211
I'd be terrified to lie to him.

516
00:26:17,415 --> 00:26:19,449
You think I'm lying to you?

517
00:26:19,516 --> 00:26:22,585
Light sensitivity isn't a
side effect of Lexapro, Tate.

518
00:26:22,652 --> 00:26:23,886
So you lied to me.

519
00:26:23,954 --> 00:26:25,120
What is important--

520
00:26:25,188 --> 00:26:26,455
that is
if you're telling the truth

521
00:26:26,522 --> 00:26:27,723
about doing these things
to your classmates.

522
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,057
If you were actually a danger

523
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,459
to society, the law says

524
00:26:30,527 --> 00:26:32,027
that I have to report you
to the police.

525
00:26:32,095 --> 00:26:33,763
Did you call them?

526
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:35,298
Not yet.

527
00:26:35,366 --> 00:26:37,634
I've treated psychotics before,
and people

528
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:40,437
with the right combination
of chemical imbalance

529
00:26:40,504 --> 00:26:43,840
and psychological damage
that can't be reached.

530
00:26:47,813 --> 00:26:49,914
You think that's me?

531
00:26:49,982 --> 00:26:51,782
You think I can't get better?

532
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,084
You? (scoffs)
You kidding me?

533
00:26:53,151 --> 00:26:55,152
You're hopeless.

534
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,353
(both laughing)

535
00:26:56,421 --> 00:26:58,288
Everybody can get better, Tate.

536
00:26:58,356 --> 00:26:59,790
Everybody.

537
00:26:59,857 --> 00:27:01,291
I just think you're scared.

538
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,792
Of what, I'm not sure yet.

539
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,561
Maybe rejection.

540
00:27:04,628 --> 00:27:05,728
Certainly

541
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:07,463
because of what
your father did to you.

542
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:10,199
I was afraid
my big dick wouldn't work.

543
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:11,701
What?

544
00:27:11,768 --> 00:27:13,169
(laughs)

545
00:27:13,236 --> 00:27:14,737
Yeah, that's why
I didn't take the meds.

546
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:15,805
Tate.
I was afraid

547
00:27:15,873 --> 00:27:16,906
my dick wouldn't work.

548
00:27:18,275 --> 00:27:19,943
Because I met someone.

549
00:27:22,514 --> 00:27:24,448
This one I did
after my dad left.

550
00:27:24,516 --> 00:27:25,850
I was ten, I think.

551
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:30,188
Last week, first day
at my new school-- sucks.

552
00:27:30,255 --> 00:27:32,589
Westfield, right?
The worst.

553
00:27:32,657 --> 00:27:34,124
I got thrown out of there.

554
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:36,760
I hate it here.
I hate everyone.

555
00:27:36,827 --> 00:27:38,595
All there bourgeoisy
designer bullshit.

556
00:27:38,663 --> 00:27:39,763
East Coast was much cooler.

557
00:27:39,831 --> 00:27:41,331
I mean, at least we had weather.

558
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:42,732
I love it
when the leaves change.

559
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,567
Yeah, me, too.

560
00:27:45,136 --> 00:27:46,669
Why did you move here?

561
00:27:46,737 --> 00:27:47,604
My dad had an affair.

562
00:27:49,006 --> 00:27:50,673
My mom literally caught him
in the act.

563
00:27:50,741 --> 00:27:52,909
That's horrible.

564
00:27:52,977 --> 00:27:55,845
If you love someone, you should
never hurt them... never.

565
00:27:55,913 --> 00:27:57,714
Right? I know.

566
00:27:57,782 --> 00:28:00,651
And the worst part is
that six months earlier,

567
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:02,787
my mom had, like, this
brutal miscarriage.

568
00:28:02,855 --> 00:28:04,322
The baby was seven months old,

569
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,224
and we had to have
this macabre funeral.

570
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,292
Have you ever seen
a baby coffin?

571
00:28:10,095 --> 00:28:13,531

the saddle ♪

572

Why are you seeing my dad?

576
00:28:25,843 --> 00:28:28,678
Don't ask questions you already
know the answer to.

577
00:28:28,746 --> 00:28:30,113
You're smarter than that.

578
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:33,249
(song stops)

579
00:28:33,317 --> 00:28:34,784
Want to listen to Morrissey?

580
00:28:34,852 --> 00:28:36,920
He's cool and he's pissy

581
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:38,354
and he hates everyone
and everything.

582
00:28:38,422 --> 00:28:40,490
Got any Kurt Cobain
on that thing?

583
00:28:40,557 --> 00:28:41,991
What are you doing in here?

584
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:43,158
Just listening to music, Dad.

585
00:28:43,226 --> 00:28:44,693
You need to leave, Tate.
I'm sorry.

586
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:48,362
He shouldn't be in here, and
I think you know that-- please.

587
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,468
What's that thing
you think I'm afraid of?

588
00:28:53,535 --> 00:28:55,302
Fear of rejection?

589
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:02,643
Stay away from him.

590
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:04,612
Dad, nothing...
You heard me!

591
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,714
No!

592
00:29:06,782 --> 00:29:09,917

Hey, babe, you seen
my razor blades?

595

596
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:31,973

Why are you in my house?!

605
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,564
(laughing continues)

606
00:30:30,023 --> 00:30:31,925
I want you to stay
out of my house.

607
00:30:31,993 --> 00:30:33,460
Do you understand?

608
00:30:33,528 --> 00:30:35,295
Can I smoke in here?
No.

609
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:37,690
Adelaide, answer me, please.

610
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,968
Can I pet your dog?

611
00:30:40,035 --> 00:30:42,478
No, Adelaide, I want you
to stay out of the house.

612
00:30:42,598 --> 00:30:43,528
I want you to stop coming in

613
00:30:43,648 --> 00:30:44,757
and opening things up

614
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,207
and telling me
that I'm going to die.

615
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:47,142
She said that?

616
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:48,677
(laughs)

617
00:30:48,744 --> 00:30:50,512
She says that to everybody.

618
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:52,781
Say you're sorry, Addy.

619
00:30:52,848 --> 00:30:54,849
No, they did it.
Who did it?

620
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:56,084
The twins.

621
00:30:56,152 --> 00:30:58,220
Shh.

622
00:30:58,287 --> 00:31:01,655
Can I...
pet your dog?

623
00:31:01,723 --> 00:31:03,457
No, Adelaide, listen to me.

624
00:31:03,525 --> 00:31:05,792
I want you to stop coming
in here without permission.

625
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,893
Am I clear?

626
00:31:06,961 --> 00:31:08,261
Vivien.
Am I clear?

627
00:31:08,329 --> 00:31:10,263
Yes.
Thank you.

628
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:15,034

BEN: Hallie!
Are you okay?

631
00:31:21,574 --> 00:31:24,276
She shouldn't have done that.

632
00:31:27,748 --> 00:31:30,316
Sorry about all this.

633
00:31:32,786 --> 00:31:35,821
You touch my kid one more time

634
00:31:35,888 --> 00:31:38,257
and I will break
your goddamn arm.

635

BEN:

No, I don't have his social.

638
00:31:45,232 --> 00:31:47,533
Listen, do not
transfer me again.

639
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:49,602
I'm trying to report a patient
of high school age,

640
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,471
that I believe
could be dangerous.

641
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:54,274
Yes. Yes, I'll hold.

642
00:31:54,342 --> 00:31:56,610
Unbelievable.

643
00:31:56,678 --> 00:31:59,012
(door rolling open)

644
00:32:03,918 --> 00:32:05,252
May I clean in here?

645
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,753
It's not a good time, Moira.

646
00:32:08,923 --> 00:32:10,290
It's Thursday.

647
00:32:10,358 --> 00:32:13,660
I get off in 20 minutes.

648
00:32:13,728 --> 00:32:16,296
If I don't do it now, it's not
getting done until Monday.

649
00:32:25,474 --> 00:32:26,875
Am I distracting you?

650
00:32:35,918 --> 00:32:38,186
Why don't you touch me
a little?

651
00:32:38,254 --> 00:32:39,287
Get out.

652
00:32:39,355 --> 00:32:40,656
What are you afraid of?

653
00:32:42,258 --> 00:32:43,558
Your wife's not home.

654
00:32:44,827 --> 00:32:46,895
She's probably at Pilates.

655
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:50,999
I won't tell.

656
00:32:52,902 --> 00:32:55,270
Oh, God.
I didn't tell when you saw me

657
00:32:55,338 --> 00:32:57,306
playing with myself
the other day.

658
00:32:57,374 --> 00:32:59,041
Please, just go.

659
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,644
Did you touch yourself after?

660
00:33:02,711 --> 00:33:03,811
Please just go.

661
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:05,513
You did.

662
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:08,816
Do it again.

663
00:33:08,884 --> 00:33:09,984
Show me.

664
00:33:10,052 --> 00:33:10,985
(door creaks)

665
00:33:12,254 --> 00:33:13,087
Oh, shit.

666
00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:19,826
Violet! Violet!

667
00:33:19,893 --> 00:33:20,927
Damn it!

668
00:33:22,763 --> 00:33:24,063
(yelling)

669
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:25,698
I'm not scared of you!
Should be!

670
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,671
KIDS (chanting):
Fight, fight, fight!

671
00:33:39,246 --> 00:33:40,947
(screams)

672
00:33:41,015 --> 00:33:42,515
Oh, she friggin' burned me!

673
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:52,293
In my professional opinion,

674
00:33:52,361 --> 00:33:56,231
whoever painted this wall had
some deep psychological issues.

675
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:58,834
I thought you had a patient.

676
00:33:58,901 --> 00:34:00,602
Ah, they bailed.
You want some help cleaning up?

677
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,037
Yeah.

678
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:05,473
Thanks.

679
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:07,742
This thing doesn't
tweak you out?

680
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:12,446
There's something about it that
I find... really comforting.

681
00:34:12,514 --> 00:34:14,715
One of my psych professors
told me that people

682
00:34:14,783 --> 00:34:16,650
tell stories to cope
with their fears.

683
00:34:16,718 --> 00:34:18,552
All art and myths
are just creations

684
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,054
to give us some sense of control
over the things we're scared of.

685
00:34:21,122 --> 00:34:22,722
Afraid of dying,
create reincarnation.

686
00:34:22,789 --> 00:34:24,657
Afraid of evil,
create a benevolent God

687
00:34:24,725 --> 00:34:26,459
who sends evildoers to Hell.

688
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:29,295
I think I just like that I don't
have to think while I do it.

689
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,464
Okay.

690
00:34:36,303 --> 00:34:39,338
I always thought you were
prettiest like this.

691
00:34:39,406 --> 00:34:42,574
No makeup. Messy hair.

692
00:34:42,642 --> 00:34:43,643
A little sweaty.

693
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,911
I'm old.

694
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:49,515
Stop.

695
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:51,850
You're beautiful.

696
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,085
You are.

697
00:34:57,824 --> 00:34:59,825
No.

698
00:34:59,893 --> 00:35:01,194
Ben...

699
00:35:01,261 --> 00:35:02,462
Violet won't be
home for an hour.

700
00:35:02,529 --> 00:35:03,530
No. Okay, Ben? No.

701
00:35:03,597 --> 00:35:04,464
Come on, babe.
Ben...

702
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:06,366
No.

703
00:35:09,403 --> 00:35:11,271
Sorry. Just no.

704
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:20,281
How long, Viv?

705
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:22,850
How long are you going
to punish me for?

706
00:35:22,918 --> 00:35:25,620
I'm not punishing you,
you narcissistic asshole!

707
00:35:25,687 --> 00:35:29,090
I'm trying to figure out
how to forgive you

708
00:35:29,158 --> 00:35:32,126
for having sex with
one of your students.

709
00:35:32,194 --> 00:35:34,362
You want me to
have sex with you?

710
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,998
I can't even look
at your face, Ben,

711
00:35:37,066 --> 00:35:38,867
without seeing the
expression on it

712
00:35:38,935 --> 00:35:41,803
while you were pile-driving
her in our bed!

713
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,471
I screwed up!

714
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:45,073
How many times do
I have to say it?

715
00:35:45,141 --> 00:35:46,541
I'm sorry!

716
00:35:46,609 --> 00:35:48,343
I was hurting, too.

717
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,377
(shouts angrily)
Oh...

718
00:35:49,445 --> 00:35:50,879
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

719
00:35:50,946 --> 00:35:54,750
Did, did the, did the life that
was growing inside you die?

720
00:35:54,817 --> 00:35:57,386
And did you have to carry
that around in your belly?

721
00:35:57,454 --> 00:35:59,955
The dead corpse
of our baby son?

722
00:36:00,023 --> 00:36:03,025
Did you have to go into labor,
and deliver our child?

723
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:03,993
Dead?

724
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:06,161
My son died too!

725
00:36:06,229 --> 00:36:07,796
My baby died, too!

726
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:11,766
And you buried your sorrow
in some 21-year-old's pussy.

727
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:14,402
You know, I could show you
statistics on how many men

728
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,003
cheat after a miscarriage.

729
00:36:16,071 --> 00:36:18,072
I was there for you, Viv.
I was patient,

730
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,873
and understanding,
and caring...

731
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:22,743
and I put your feelings first.

732
00:36:24,245 --> 00:36:26,747
My hero.

733
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:31,251
You know, I don't even
know how to say this

734
00:36:31,286 --> 00:36:31,318
without coming off like
an asshole, I really don't.

735
00:36:33,255 --> 00:36:34,656
You know what? Just go ahead.

736
00:36:34,723 --> 00:36:37,325
Really.
Never stopped you before.

737
00:36:37,393 --> 00:36:40,529
You're so angry, why don't you
really tell it like it is?

738
00:36:40,597 --> 00:36:43,566
Six months of therapy
with you apologizing,

739
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:46,969
and crying, was bullshit.

740
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:49,672
So, please, tell me
how you really feel.

741
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:51,273
You got a dog.

742
00:36:52,642 --> 00:36:54,976
I needed you,
and you got a dog.

743
00:36:55,044 --> 00:36:56,544
Oh...!

744
00:36:56,612 --> 00:36:59,147
It was me you should have been
curling up with at night!

745
00:36:59,214 --> 00:37:00,248
Not a dog!

746
00:37:00,315 --> 00:37:01,749
Oh, so...
I needed you!

747
00:37:01,817 --> 00:37:05,285
You needed me? So she was
revenge, because you needed me,

748
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:07,855
because I wasn't there for
you in your time of need?

749
00:37:07,923 --> 00:37:09,223
Now I get it!

750
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:12,827
We haven't had sex
in almost a year.

751
00:37:12,895 --> 00:37:14,496
Yeah... you think
I don't know that?

752
00:37:14,563 --> 00:37:16,464
October 20th.

753
00:37:16,532 --> 00:37:20,770
We had great sex, babe.
It was loving and sexy

754
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:23,106
and personal, and even
a little, even a little weird.

755
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,913
I love you.

756
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,482
I moved across country for you.

757
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,617
Because, in all my life,

758
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,685
the only thing I've
been truly scared of

759
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,755
is losing you;
losing this family.

760
00:37:40,657 --> 00:37:43,525
Something horrible
happened to us.

761
00:37:43,593 --> 00:37:47,128
And we handled it
even more horribly.

762
00:37:47,196 --> 00:37:49,598
But this...

763
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:51,633
this place...

764
00:37:51,701 --> 00:37:54,937
is our second chance, babe.

765
00:37:55,004 --> 00:37:56,405
It's our second chance.

766
00:37:58,541 --> 00:37:59,608
But I just...

767
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:05,782
I just need to know
that you want it, too.

768
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:09,586
Tell me, honey.

769
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:14,525
What are you doing?

770
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,794
Viv...

771
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,128
What are you doing?

772
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:20,097
Oh!

773
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:28,505
(panting)

774
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,814
BEN:
We're going to be happy here.

775
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:42,741
Here you go, Hallie.

776
00:38:42,962 --> 00:38:46,056
Good girl. Hey.

777
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:49,067
Whoa. Come here.

778
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:51,737
What happened to your face?

779
00:38:51,857 --> 00:38:53,721
Fell down.
(sighs)

780
00:38:53,837 --> 00:38:54,463
Come here.

781
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,339
Sit, sit, sit.

782
00:38:56,407 --> 00:38:57,640
Boy or girl?

783
00:38:57,708 --> 00:38:59,250
Girls. Three of them.

784
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,844
Hope they look
worse than you do.

785
00:39:01,457 --> 00:39:02,776
You know their names?

786
00:39:02,894 --> 00:39:04,194
I'm not narking.

787
00:39:04,262 --> 00:39:06,397
You know, we can easily move
you to a different school.

788
00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:08,733
There are a lot of really
good private schools

789
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,235
right in this neighborhood.

790
00:39:10,302 --> 00:39:12,702
I'm not running away.
I'm not scared of them.

791
00:39:12,822 --> 00:39:14,673
Not afraid of anything.

792
00:39:14,741 --> 00:39:17,210
It's like that time
in kindergarten,

793
00:39:17,278 --> 00:39:19,780
when you insisted that I bring
you home from the slumber party

794
00:39:19,847 --> 00:39:21,915
'cause all the other girls were
sleeping with the nightlight on.

795
00:39:23,618 --> 00:39:25,486
I know you've gotten the short
end of the stick, lately.

796
00:39:25,553 --> 00:39:27,421
This move, and...

797
00:39:29,357 --> 00:39:31,725
...your dad and I haven't
exactly been great to be around.

798
00:39:31,793 --> 00:39:33,894
Why don't you guys get divorced,
if you're so miserable?

799
00:39:33,962 --> 00:39:35,797
We still love each other.

800
00:39:35,865 --> 00:39:36,864
You could've fooled me.

801
00:39:36,932 --> 00:39:39,200
I thought you hated each other.

802
00:39:39,268 --> 00:39:40,969
Well, at least you hated him.

803
00:39:41,036 --> 00:39:43,104
I don't blame you.
He was a shithead.

804
00:39:44,506 --> 00:39:46,440
Sorry.

805
00:39:46,508 --> 00:39:48,342
It's okay.

806
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,376
He was a shithead.

807
00:39:51,045 --> 00:39:52,579
You know, we got
a lot of history.

808
00:39:52,647 --> 00:39:55,115
Your dad's been through a lot,
I've been through a lot.

809
00:39:58,586 --> 00:40:00,453
Guess we need each other.

810
00:40:01,588 --> 00:40:03,956
What are you scared of?

811
00:40:04,024 --> 00:40:05,558
You said I'm not scared
of anything, so...

812
00:40:05,626 --> 00:40:07,059
what scares you?

813
00:40:07,127 --> 00:40:08,994
Lately?

814
00:40:10,096 --> 00:40:11,497
Everything.

815
00:40:14,734 --> 00:40:17,670
Life will do that to you.

816
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:18,704
VIOLET:
<i>I hate her!</i>

817
00:40:18,772 --> 00:40:20,206
I just want to kill her!

818
00:40:20,274 --> 00:40:22,141
Then do it!
One less high school bitch

819
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:23,910
making the lives of
the less fortunate

820
00:40:23,977 --> 00:40:26,179
more tolerable is, in my
opinion, a public service.

821
00:40:26,246 --> 00:40:27,380
Look, you want her
to leave you alone?

822
00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:28,781
Stop making your
life a living hell?

823
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:30,850
Short of killing her,
there's only one solution.

824
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:33,218
Scare her.
Make her afraid of you.

825
00:40:33,286 --> 00:40:34,653
It's the only thing
bullies react to.

826
00:40:34,721 --> 00:40:36,322
How?
It's simple.

827
00:40:36,389 --> 00:40:37,890
<i>You simply walk up</i>
<i>to her and say,</i>

828
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:39,458
Here's the deal: I need you
to stop harassing me.

829
00:40:39,526 --> 00:40:41,694
I got what you want. Drugs.

830
00:40:41,761 --> 00:40:43,595
Come to my house tomorrow
for your free sample.

831
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:47,432
I'm a dealer, and a good one.
I got the best shit in town.

832
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,234
She's a cokehead.
I don't have coke.

833
00:40:49,302 --> 00:40:51,403
You won't need any. It's just
an excuse to get her here.

834
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,804
After that, she'll leave
empty-handed and terrified.

835
00:40:53,872 --> 00:40:56,875
And I promise you, you'll never
be bothered by her again.

836
00:40:56,942 --> 00:40:58,743
How am I going to terrify her?
Helter-skelter!

837
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:00,445
That's where I come in.

838
00:41:16,462 --> 00:41:18,030
Hot.

839
00:41:20,266 --> 00:41:22,467
I thought I told you
to throw that thing away.

840
00:41:22,535 --> 00:41:24,169
Oh, you're not talking?

841
00:41:26,905 --> 00:41:29,206
Well, I'll give you
points for creativity.

842
00:41:29,274 --> 00:41:31,075
We were pretty hot
this afternoon.

843
00:41:33,344 --> 00:41:36,245
You really want to go
for round two, huh?

844
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:37,913
Come on. I can be kinky.

845
00:41:45,222 --> 00:41:48,158
(eerie, distorted whispering)

846
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:01,340
(moaning)

847
00:42:07,547 --> 00:42:09,547
(moaning, gasping)

848
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:25,796
Now is not your time.

849
00:42:29,334 --> 00:42:31,869
Enjoy the house.

850
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:36,041
(whispering):
Go back to bed.

851
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:00,833
I love you.

852
00:43:00,901 --> 00:43:03,336
(flatly):
I love you, too.

853
00:43:11,233 --> 00:43:12,307
What's down there?

854
00:43:12,534 --> 00:43:13,223
VIOLET:
My stash.

855
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:14,907
Parents toss
my room every week.

856
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:16,599
If you're screwing with me...

857
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,012
It's just the basement.

858
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,211
I found the best hiding place.

859
00:43:19,279 --> 00:43:20,680
This is great shit, too.

860
00:43:20,748 --> 00:43:23,083
All the coke coming
to the U.S. from Central America

861
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,619
smuggled in on lobster boats
in Gloucester.

862
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,354
I used to show my boobs
to the lobstermen

863
00:43:27,422 --> 00:43:29,389
in return for a key or two
before they cut it.

864
00:43:29,457 --> 00:43:31,291
So where is it?

865
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,760
Right around the corner.

866
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:39,233
To the right.

867
00:43:39,301 --> 00:43:41,335
This place is a dump.

868
00:43:41,403 --> 00:43:43,204
Oh, shut up.

869
00:43:43,271 --> 00:43:44,671
I want my goddamn drugs.

870
00:43:44,739 --> 00:43:46,673
Then keep going.

871
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:50,710
So this is the coke whore.

872
00:43:50,778 --> 00:43:52,478
Who the hell are you?

873
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,312
Get the lights.

874
00:43:55,282 --> 00:43:57,716
(electricity buzzing)

875
00:43:57,784 --> 00:44:00,552
(crazed laughter)

876
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:04,257
What is going on?!
What is going on?!

877
00:44:04,325 --> 00:44:06,359
(hissing)

878
00:44:06,427 --> 00:44:10,230
Kill her! Kill her!
Kill her! Kill her!

879
00:44:10,298 --> 00:44:12,165
(screams)

880
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,768
Get off of me! Get off of me!
(screams)

881
00:44:14,836 --> 00:44:17,805
Get off me! Get off me!

882
00:44:19,007 --> 00:44:20,274
Stop!

883
00:44:22,645 --> 00:44:25,613
Stop! Please, stop!

884
00:44:26,315 --> 00:44:28,683
(Violet screams)

885
00:44:30,786 --> 00:44:32,086
(screaming continues)

886
00:44:34,322 --> 00:44:35,456
Mommy...?

887
00:44:37,493 --> 00:44:38,625
(screaming)

888
00:44:40,729 --> 00:44:44,465
(screaming continues)

889
00:44:44,532 --> 00:44:47,601
Will you wait?!

890
00:44:47,669 --> 00:44:49,436
I don't think she'll be
bothering you anymore.

891
00:44:49,504 --> 00:44:50,871
What was that?!
What are you talking about?

892
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:52,339
She hit me in the balls
and got away.

893
00:44:52,407 --> 00:44:53,641
She must have run into
a wall or something.

894
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:55,142
No, I saw something!

895
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:56,710
What are you talk...?
Violet, you're talking crazy.

896
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:58,479
This is cool.
We showed that bitch.

897
00:44:58,547 --> 00:45:01,382
Damn!
I never want to see you again!

898
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:09,592
I thought you weren't afraid
of anything!

899
00:45:21,271 --> 00:45:23,639
(car approaching)

900
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:53,939
Who are you and why
are you following me?!

901
00:45:54,007 --> 00:45:55,541
Your family is in danger!

902
00:45:57,644 --> 00:45:59,679
What happened to you?

903
00:45:59,746 --> 00:46:01,614
Pretty, aren't I?

904
00:46:01,682 --> 00:46:03,983
It's over 70% of my body.

905
00:46:06,453 --> 00:46:08,421
I'm Larry Harvey.

906
00:46:08,488 --> 00:46:10,589
And you have to get
out of that house.

907
00:46:10,657 --> 00:46:12,191
I could have you
arrested, you know.

908
00:46:12,259 --> 00:46:14,360
Peeking in people's windows
is still a crime.

909
00:46:14,427 --> 00:46:15,561
Even in L.A.

910
00:46:15,629 --> 00:46:18,732
They're not gonna put me
back into jail.

911
00:46:18,799 --> 00:46:21,735
I have brain cancer.

912
00:46:21,803 --> 00:46:24,338
Terminal, inoperable.

913
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,706
I'm sorry.

914
00:46:25,774 --> 00:46:30,278
Don't be. That's the only reason
they let me out.

915
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:35,317
Homicide. Triple homicide.

916
00:46:35,384 --> 00:46:37,119
I was in that house
for six months

917
00:46:37,186 --> 00:46:39,054
before I started
hearing voices.

918
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:42,757
My wife thought
I was working too hard.

919
00:46:42,825 --> 00:46:47,262
My daughter Angie was six.

920
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:51,232
The older one,
Margaret, was ten.

921
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,268
She looked like her mother.

922
00:46:54,336 --> 00:46:58,238
That's funny how it skips
a generation like that.

923
00:47:03,745 --> 00:47:06,847
I killed them... all.

924
00:47:08,851 --> 00:47:12,087
<i>Lorraine was ill that night.</i>
<i>She took a pill.</i>

925
00:47:12,154 --> 00:47:14,623
<i>She went to bed early, my wife.</i>

926
00:47:14,691 --> 00:47:18,261
<i>And then I, uh,</i>
<i>I put the girls down,</i>

927
00:47:18,329 --> 00:47:20,463
<i>and then the voices started.</i>

928
00:47:20,531 --> 00:47:22,565
(eerie, distorted whispering)

929
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,102
<i>They told me what to do.</i>

930
00:47:27,738 --> 00:47:29,906
<i>I was like...</i>

931
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:32,675
<i>an obedient child.</i>

932
00:48:02,408 --> 00:48:04,408
(crying)

933
00:48:07,045 --> 00:48:09,513
I... (sobs)

934
00:48:14,887 --> 00:48:17,054
(sighs)

935
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:21,124
I don't know how
I put myself out.

936
00:48:21,192 --> 00:48:22,192
(snaps fingers)

937
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,729
I remember that night...

938
00:48:25,797 --> 00:48:27,364
but it's like a dream.

939
00:48:27,432 --> 00:48:30,401
Have you been sleepwalking?

940
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:33,737
Yeah... Look at my case.

941
00:48:33,805 --> 00:48:35,506
Read the transcript.

942
00:48:35,573 --> 00:48:37,841
Listen to me, I'm a doctor.

943
00:48:37,909 --> 00:48:39,743
They may not put
you back in jail,

944
00:48:39,811 --> 00:48:41,178
but I can certainly
have you committed

945
00:48:41,246 --> 00:48:42,480
to a state mental institution.

946
00:48:42,547 --> 00:48:44,482
And trust me,
those places make prison

947
00:48:44,549 --> 00:48:45,950
look like Club Med.

948
00:48:46,018 --> 00:48:48,619
Leave my family alone!
Do you hear me?

949
00:48:48,687 --> 00:48:51,256
Please, please, please,
you have to get out of there!

950
00:48:51,324 --> 00:48:53,892
That place is evil.

951
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,894
Get off of me!

952
00:48:56,096 --> 00:48:57,263
Leave us alone!

953
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:58,297
Leave us alone!

954
00:49:14,714 --> 00:49:16,649
Put those earrings back.

955
00:49:16,716 --> 00:49:18,150
(slamming)

956
00:49:18,218 --> 00:49:20,052
Jesus H. Christ.

957
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,454
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

958
00:49:21,522 --> 00:49:23,923
Those belonged to madam.

959
00:49:23,991 --> 00:49:25,892
This is her house, not yours.

960
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:29,128
Why is it that it is
always the old whore

961
00:49:29,196 --> 00:49:31,931
who acts the part
of a moralistic prude?

962
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:37,069
I'd be nervous
if I were you, too.

963
00:49:37,137 --> 00:49:42,041
When things go missing, they
always blame the new maid.

964
00:49:44,478 --> 00:49:45,812
I'd move if I were you.

965
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:52,519
Don't make me kill you again.

966
00:50:11,237 --> 00:50:12,370
Hey.

967
00:50:12,438 --> 00:50:13,805
Hey.

968
00:50:13,873 --> 00:50:16,107
What do you want for dinner?

969
00:50:16,175 --> 00:50:17,541
Whatever you want.

970
00:50:17,609 --> 00:50:20,511
I think I want Indian food.

971
00:50:22,914 --> 00:50:25,182
You only like Indian food
when you're pregnant.

972
00:50:34,093 --> 00:50:35,760
Really?

973
00:50:35,828 --> 00:50:37,762
Mm. (chuckles)

974
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:40,832
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

975
00:50:43,702 --> 00:50:45,036
Oh...!

976
00:50:53,945 --> 00:50:56,080
MAN (echoing, distorted):
<i>And I got a gun!</i>

977
